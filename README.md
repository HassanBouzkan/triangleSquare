n this code, we first import the turtle module and create a turtle object t. To draw a triangle, we use a for loop to iterate over the three sides and use the forward() and left() methods to draw each side. To draw a square, we move the turtle to a new starting position using the penup() and goto() methods, and then draw the square using another for loop.

Finally, we use the exitonclick() method to exit the turtle screen when we click on it. You can modify the code to change the size, position, and color of the shapes, as well as to add other shapes or designs.
